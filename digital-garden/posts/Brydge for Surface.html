        <br><br>TL;DR: Overall experience of the Brydge is great. Keyboard and trackpad feel a little cheap compared to Type Cover, but is worth sacrificing for a hinge. After using it for a while, I am not concerned about the hinge damaging the display. Just don't chuck it around like a maniac. 
        <br>
        <br><br>I've used the Surface Type Cover since I first got with my Surface Pro 6, so it has seen some wear and tear. Switching to the <a href="https://www.brydge.com/products/brydge-12-3-pro">Brydge 12.3 Pro+</a> (kinda stupid name) took some getting used to. 
        <br><br>The build quality of the Brydge is great. The keyboard layout is pretty much identical to the Type Cover. 
        <br><br><h3># Bluetooth</h3>The Brydge takes a couple of seconds to wake up, which is to be expected for a bluetooth keyboard. Sometimes the trackpad starts lagging but it is able to fix the connection on it's own. Occasionally turning on-and-off the keybaord is needed to fix it. 
        <br><br>I try not to have multiple bluetooth devices connected, which usually causes the Brydge's trackpad to lag. 
        <br><br><h3># Hinge</h3>Arguably the most important part of the keyboard, and also the part the I feared the most. 
        <br><br>Some users reported that their screen's have shattered due to the hinge design of the Brydge, but I think it won't be a problem unless you put a stupid amount of pressure on the device. 
        <br><br>At a certain point when closing the screen, the Brydge collapses on it's own, probably to relieve some of the pressure around the hinge-to-screen area. 
        <br><br><h3># Trackpad</h3>This is an important part of the keyboard, but maybe my least favorite switch from the Type Cover. I was never annoyed by the small trackpad on the Type Cover, so switching to a larger one was nice. The trackpad of the Brydge feels solid, but overall the user-experience is less smooth. 
        <br><br>It was one of the first things I noticed, because I've always used very high cursor speed (9 in Window's Settings). The speed was a little different between the two trackpads. It's very small, but just something I've grown used to on the Type Cover. 
        <br><br><h3># Weight</h3>Adds a lot of weight to the overall package. You notice it everytime you pick it up.

        <hr>
        <br><br><span style="font-weight:bold">Recommendation</span>: Don't buy if you don't have a Surface device (duh)
        <br>A really unecessary buy unless you <span style="font-style:italic">really</span> want a true laptop experience for the Surface Pro/Go/X and have a couple of bucks to spend. 
        <br><br>I think I'll probably keep using the Brydge because my Type Cover is in 'eh' condition. 
        <br><br>PS. I got the Brydge for quite a discount (over 50% off), so it might be discontinuing or something. Wouldn't recommend paying too much for it.
